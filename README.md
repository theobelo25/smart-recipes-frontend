This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Deploy on Dokploy (Nixpacks)

1. **Node version** – The repo pins Node 24 via `engines.node` and `.nvmrc`; Nixpacks will use it automatically.
2. **Build env** – Set **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`** in Dokploy for this app to your **backend’s public URL** (e.g. `https://api.yourdomain.com`). This is inlined at build time, so it must be set in the build environment.
3. **Port** – Next.js `start` uses `PORT` if set; Dokploy usually provides it. No change needed unless your platform expects a specific port.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` locally; in Dokploy, configure the variable in the project UI instead of committing secrets.
